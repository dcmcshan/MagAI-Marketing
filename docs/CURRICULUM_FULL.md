# Mag.AI-M — Full Curriculum (18 Courses)

**Castalia Institute — Magister of Artificial Intelligence in Marketing**

*Authoritative copy: part of the MyST project (`myst.yml`). Do not maintain a separate curriculum elsewhere.*

This document summarizes all **18 courses** across **3 terms**. Each entry states what the student **builds**, **why it matters**, and which **AI systems** support the work.

**Delivery:** Students learn and practice AI primarily in **iNQspace** — notebooks, simulations, and artifact lineage — aligned with Castalia’s “build worlds, don’t only discuss them” standard.

**Marketing tools (MCP):** Across terms, students **leverage** and **build** [**Model Context Protocol**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) integrations for real marketing data and actions — analytics, CRM, ads, content systems — with explicit scopes and governance. See `docs/MCP_MARKETING.md`.

**Legend — AI systems**

| System | Role in courses |
| --- | --- |
| **PTAH** | Ontology, rules, simulation, scenario generation |
| **SAMWISE** | Reflection, pattern detection, assumption critique, journal |
| **AI Faculty** | Competing frames, adversarial challenges, alternative narratives |
| **MCP** | Marketing tools & data: connect AI workflows to external systems; build or extend MCP servers where courses require it |

**Cross-cutting:** Any course artifact that uses **live** marketing data or **actions** (not purely synthetic) should document **MCP** tool surfaces, scopes, and governance per `docs/MCP_MARKETING.md`.

## TERM I — Audience & Message Worlds

*Objective:* Formalize **attention, trust, and message dynamics** as simulatable worlds before scaling real spend.

---

### AIN-M6001 — Personal Attention & Influence Systems

**Description:** Students construct an **executable model of their own attention, credibility, and message–market fit** as interacting stocks and flows. The self is treated as the smallest marketing system: what you attend to, what you signal, and how you allocate creative time — not a productivity blog dressed as strategy.

**Key topics:** Ontology for attention and credibility; time allocation for creation vs distribution; trust as a stock; message–audience fit as measurable mismatch; content economics (cost to produce vs reach); integration as substrate for later courses.

**Required artifact:** **Executable self-influence model** with documented assumptions and at least three perturbation scenarios.

**AI systems used:** PTAH (primary), SAMWISE (reflection), AI Faculty (a.Porter on differentiation of self; a.Taleb on reputation tails). **MCP:** leverage approved marketing/data tools; optional build path for personal instrumentation (see `docs/MCP_MARKETING.md`).

**Prerequisites:** None.

---

### AIN-M6002 — Audience Worlds

**Description:** Students build **populations of agents** with heterogeneous attention budgets, trust thresholds, channel habits, and decision rules. **Emergence from rules**, not personas on slides: segmentation, sensitivity, and churn-like dynamics must appear from mechanics.

**Prerequisites:** AIN-M6001 recommended.

---

### AIN-M6003 — Positioning & Narrative Systems

**Description:** Students model **positioning and story** as mechanisms: what claims do, what categories they invoke, how narratives change perception over time. **Positioning is not a slogan** — it is a set of constraints and feedback loops in an audience world.

### AIN-M6004 — Brand as Dynamic System

**Required artifact:** **Brand dynamic model** with scenarios (creative refresh, PR shock, competitor move).

### AIN-M6005 — Channel & Content Economics

**Required artifact:** **Channel + content economics** simulation with scenario set.

**AI systems used:** PTAH, SAMWISE (metric gaming), AI Faculty (growth vs brand tension).

**Prerequisites:** AIN-M6004.

### AIN-M6006 — Measurement, Privacy & Compliance

**Key topics:** Event models; attribution limits; consent states; platform policy shocks; audit risk; documentation for defensibility.

**Required artifact:** **Constrained measurement world** extending prior work with explicit constraint objects and scenario results.

**AI systems used:** PTAH, SAMWISE (what you ignored because it was inconvenient), AI Faculty (ethics + a.Taleb on fragility of centralized control).

**Prerequisites:** AIN-M6005.
