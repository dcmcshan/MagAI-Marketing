## I. Purpose

### Definition

Mag.AI-Marketing is a post-graduate program focused on the design, simulation, and deployment of **AI-native marketing systems**: audiences, messages, channels, measurement, and ethics as **executable worlds**, not slide decks.

It is **not**:

- a tactics checklist
- a “growth hacking” bootcamp
- a platform-specific tool course

It **is**:

> A discipline of constructing and testing marketing realities through simulation before spending attention and budget in the wild.

### Core Thesis

> **Marketing is a world model with attention, trust, and measurable persuasion.**

Therefore:

- understanding marketing = modeling how people attend, believe, and act
- learning marketing = refining those models under evidence
- mastery = designing influence systems that survive reality and scrutiny

---

## II. Degree Philosophy

### 1. Simulation First

Students begin by formalizing **who** is in the world, **what** they perceive, **how** messages move, and **what** counts as success — then they perturb before they scale spend.

### 2. Student as Author

Students:

- define audience ontology
- choose assumptions explicitly
- encode rules and measurement
- own their models

AI does not replace judgment about ethics, brand, or truthfulness.

### 3. AI as Instrument

| System | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **PTAH** | Constructs and simulates marketing worlds |
| **SAMWISE** | Reflects, critiques, remembers |
| **AI Faculty** | Competing frames (positioning, behavior, narrative, risk) |

**Technical AI literacy (explicit):** Parallel to world models, students build competence in **evaluating AI in marketing workflows**: RAG/grounding quality, **prompt and version discipline**, human-in-the-loop review, cost/latency tradeoffs, and **red-teaming** customer-facing flows. This is not a separate “AI minor”; it is **embedded** in campaign, data, automation, and ethics courses (see `CURRICULUM_FULL.md`, *AI literacy spine*).

### 4. Knowledge as Metabolism

Students continuously:

- ingest signals (analytics, qual research, competitive intel)
- refine models
- test assumptions
- ship measurable artifacts

---

## III. Learning Model

### Traditional Model (Rejected)

```
template → post → hope
```

### Magister Model (Adopted)

```
define audience world → simulate → perturb → refine → deploy
```

### Core Loop

1. Construct world (PTAH)
2. Run simulation / scenario set
3. Observe outcomes
4. Reflect (SAMWISE)
5. Challenge (Faculty)
6. Revise model
7. Deploy with measurement

---

## IV. Program Structure

### Degree Path

```
Bac.AI → Lic.AI → Mag.AI-M
```

Mag.AI-M is equivalent to applied doctorate-level mastery in marketing design.

### Duration

- 3 Terms (or flexible pacing)
- Each term increases world complexity (audience → campaign org → competitive strategy)

### Workload and milestones

Eighteen courses are **artifact sprints**, not implicitly “semester-long” loads. Faculty set **minimum viable artifacts** and may **sequence or combine** milestones so students do not carry eighteen simultaneous builds. Over-scoping is treated as a **failure mode** to catch in advising.

### Instructional stack and fallbacks

**Primary stack:** PTAH (worlds), SAMWISE (reflection), iNQspace (execution, lineage), AI Faculty (challenge), MCP (tools). If any component is **unavailable** to a cohort, delivery uses **approved substitutes**: e.g. **Python/notebook** worlds with explicit ontology docs for PTAH-shaped work; **structured reflection templates** for SAMWISE; **generic notebook + Git** lineage for iNQspace; MCP optional on **faculty-hosted or synthetic** endpoints (see `MCP_MARKETING.md`). The **curriculum outcomes** do not depend on a single proprietary binary.

## VI. Core Technologies

### iNQspace

**iNQspace is the primary environment in which we teach AI** for this program: guided labs, course notebooks, simulations, integrations with models and data workflows, and **lineage** so work is inspectable and revisable. Lectures set direction; competence is built by doing — building worlds, running perturbations, and reflecting — inside iNQspace. It is the operational bridge between “understanding AI in marketing” and **demonstrable** skill.

In practice, iNQspace provides:

- **Notebooks and runnable artifacts** (course exercises, thesis components)
- **Simulation runs** tied to PTAH-style world models
- **AI-in-the-loop workflows** where appropriate (grounding, evaluation, not prompt tourism)
- **Versioning / lineage** for iteration and defense

### MCP (marketing tools)

The [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is how courses **connect AI workflows to real marketing systems** — analytics, CRM, ad accounts, content CMS, enrichment APIs — with **explicit tool contracts** instead of ad hoc scraping or mystery plugins. Students **leverage** existing MCP servers (faculty-approved) and **build** or extend servers when a course artifact requires a custom bridge to data or simulators.

The curriculum **emphasizes tools** by naming **major platform ecosystems**—**social (Meta-class)**, **Google (Search/Ads/Analytics/YouTube)**, **Amazon (marketplace + ads)**—as **modeled and measurable** environments, not vendor trivia (see `CURRICULUM_FULL.md`).

MCP is not “extra IT.” It is how **deployment** (Dimension D in assessment) stays **inspectable**: which tools ran, with what scope, and what evidence was produced. Program-wide expectations and guardrails: **`docs/MCP_MARKETING.md`**.

### MyST Markdown (content layer)

Program **content** — syllabi, lectures, public pages, design docs — is authored in **MyST Markdown** (`.md`) so materials can ship as structured documents, cross-linked sites, and exports (HTML/PDF/Word via the [MyST](https://mystmd.org) toolchain). The repository root **`myst.yml`** declares **`project.toc`**: that list is the **canonical boundary** of what the program treats as “the book.” The GitHub **`README.md`** is **outside** the MyST project on purpose: it only points here; it must not duplicate curriculum text.

**Content derivation (everything flows from MyST):**

1. **Author** in `.md` / `.ipynb` under paths listed or matched in `myst.yml`.
2. **Build the Jupyter Book** with `myst start` / `myst build` or **`jupyter-book build --site`** (same engine; Jupyter Book is the umbrella CLI for many teams). Optional **exports** (PDF, Word, JATS, slides PDF) via `jupyter-book build --pdf …` etc.
3. **Structure:** **Book** = full `project.toc` site (read linearly). **Slides** = `slides/*.md` with `+++` frame separators for Beamer-style export. **Exercises** = `{exercise}` / `{solution}` in `exercises/**/*.md` (and optionally mirrored in notebooks with gated syntax).
4. **Teach** in **iNQspace** by importing or syncing those paths — syllabi and lecture text are not retyped inside the lab; **execution** (notebooks, sims, lineage) lives in iNQspace. **MCP** connects labs to marketing tools and data under policy.
5. **Do not** maintain a parallel copy of curriculum in wikis, slide decks, or the README — if it is not in the MyST tree, it is not authoritative.

MyST is the authoring and publishing layer; **Jupyter Book** is the primary build entrypoint for book + slides + exercises; **iNQspace** is the execution layer.

### PTAH

Ontology, rules, scenarios for audiences, messages, channels.

### SAMWISE

Reflection, pattern detection, assumption critique.

## XII. Final Statement

Mag.AI-Marketing is a program for people who want **leverage without fog**: models you can run, defend, and connect to real outcomes.

At completion, the graduate possesses a **full toolbox** — not a checklist of courses, but **reusable artifacts**: simulatable worlds, deployment evidence, **technical AI practice** (eval, grounding, oversight) in real workflows, MCP-governed marketing tool connections, reflection practice, and publishable documentation (MyST / Jupyter Book). The credential attests that those tools exist, run, and can be defended.

Graduates are:

> **Designers of influence under constraint.**
