# AIN-M6001: Personal Attention & Influence Systems

**Term I — Mag.AI-Marketing**  
**Castalia Institute**

*Authoritative copy: part of the MyST project (`myst.yml`).*

---

## Course Overview

Every marketing system begins with a person allocating **finite attention** and **finite trust** to produce **perceived value** and **action**. Before you model an audience at scale, you model yourself as the smallest complete marketing world.

AIN-M6001 is the first course in the Mag.AI-M program. Students construct an executable model of their own **attention budget, credibility, message–audience fit, content economics, and integrated influence trajectory** — the template for audience worlds, campaigns, and strategy that follow.

### Final Artifact

An executable **self-influence model**: a simulation that takes your inputs (hours, credibility, message clarity, content costs) and runs scenarios — what happens if you shift time from creation to distribution, invest in trust, narrow your audience, or absorb a reputation shock.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Define an ontology for a personal marketing world (attention, trust, message, channel effort)
2. Encode assumptions as computable rules
3. Build a simulation that steps forward in time
4. Perturb the simulation to test scenarios
5. Reflect on model quality using SAMWISE
6. Defend the model against Faculty challenge
7. Connect the model to **real signals** where appropriate using **MCP**-backed marketing tools (and document scope, limits, and ethics)

## Technology Stack

| System | Role in this course |
| --- | --- |
| **PTAH** | Build the world: entities, rules, simulations |
| **SAMWISE** | Reflect after each session |
| **AI Faculty** | Challenge assumptions: a.Porter (differentiation), a.Taleb (reputation tails) |
| **MCP** | **Marketing tools:** leverage approved MCP servers to pull metrics, content, or segments into notebooks/agents; optional **build** of a small MCP tool surface for personal or synthetic data (see `docs/MCP_MARKETING.md`) |
| **iNQspace** | **Primary teaching environment:** notebooks, labs, simulations, AI-assisted builds, artifact lineage — where students learn AI by building and running models |

## Course Structure

6 lectures. Each lecture has **Concept**, **PTAH Notebook**, **SAMWISE Reflection**, **Faculty Challenge**.

## Lecture Sequence

### Lecture 1: What Is a Marketing World Model?

**Concept:** A marketing world model specifies who attends, what they believe, what messages exist, and how effort maps to reach and conversion. Your **personal** influence system is the smallest such world.

**PTAH Notebook:** `01_first_marketing_world.ipynb` — `Marketer` entity: `attention_hours_day`, `credibility`, `core_message_clarity`, `audience_touchpoints`; rule: `signal_reach = f(attention, credibility)`; run 30 ticks.

**SAMWISE Reflection:** What did you include or omit? What cannot this model represent?

**Faculty Challenge — Dr. a.Porter:**  
> "You modeled reach, but not *why anyone should listen*. Where is differentiation in your personal system — not slogans, but **choice**?"

---

### Lecture 2: Attention as the Primary Constraint

**Concept:** Attention is scarcer than time: **unclaimed focus** is the inventory marketing competes for. Allocation across creation, distribution, learning, and rest shapes everything downstream.

**PTAH Notebook:** `02_attention_allocation.ipynb` — `AttentionBlock` entities; productivity curve; rule: `effective_signal = attention * clarity * credibility_multiplier`.

**SAMWISE Reflection:** Stated vs revealed priorities; highest-leverage hour for your message.

**Faculty Challenge — Dr. a.Taleb:**  
> "Attention has fat tails — one scandal can dominate a year of careful posting. Where is **tail risk** in your model?"

---

### Lecture 3: Credibility, Trust, and Reputation Leverage

**Concept:** Credibility is a **stock** replenished by consistency and depleted by overclaiming. Not all visibility is the same: **trust leverage** changes how the same effort converts.

**PTAH Notebook:** `03_credibility_leverage.ipynb` — `credibility` state; rules for proof vs promise; scenarios: endorsements, mistakes, silence.

**SAMWISE Reflection:** Where are you borrowing trust you have not earned?

**Faculty Challenge — Dr. a.Porter:**  
> "Reputation is strategic. What are you *not* saying to preserve optionality — and is that omission modeled?"

---

### Lecture 4: Message–Market Fit as Measurable Mismatch

**Concept:** **Fit** is the distance between what you say and what a specific audience needs to hear — reducible to variables in simulation, not vibes.

**PTAH Notebook:** `04_message_market_fit.ipynb` — audience need vector vs message vector; mismatch score; sensitivity to clarity and niche width.

**SAMWISE Reflection:** Who exactly is the audience in your model — and who did you exclude to make the math easy?

**Faculty Challenge — Dr. a.Porter:**  
> "Narrow positioning trades reach for resonance. Show me the tradeoff curve in your simulation, not in prose."

---

### Lecture 5: Content Economics and Creative Runway

**Concept:** Content has **unit cost** (time, tools, collaborators) and **decay** (feed half-life). **Creative runway** is how long you can sustain output at quality *q* without burning out or boring the audience.

**PTAH Notebook:** `05_content_runway.ipynb` — production cost per unit; backlog; quality decay under speed; runway under attention shock.

**SAMWISE Reflection:** Biggest hidden cost in your creative stack?

**Faculty Challenge — Dr. a.Taleb:**  
> "You optimized posting frequency. Convexity: sometimes **silence** is the optimal strategy. Can your model represent abstaining as a move?"

---

### Lecture 6: Integration — Your Personal Influence System

**Concept:** Combine attention, credibility, message fit, and content economics into one **PersonalInfluence** world. Sensitivity analysis and three scenarios: baseline, optimized, stress (reputation hit + attention crash).

**PTAH Notebook:** `06_integration.ipynb` — full integration; scenarios; one-page influence report.

**SAMWISE Reflection:** Single most important insight; what will you change in real life?

**Faculty Challenge — Full Panel:** Porter (differentiation), Taleb (tails), behavioral frame (bias in self-perception).

## Assessment
