# Mag.AI-Marketing

**Castalia Institute — Magister of Artificial Intelligence in Marketing**

> Marketing is a world model with attention, trust, and measurable persuasion.

---

## What Is This?

Mag.AI-Marketing treats marketing not as a bag of tactics, but as a domain of **formalizable, simulatable worlds**: audiences, messages, channels, and outcomes you can build, perturb, and measure before you spend real attention and budget.

This is not a traditional “digital marketing certificate.” Graduates are not campaign button-pushers — they are **designers of influence under constraint**.

### Core Loop

```
Define audience world → Simulate message & channel dynamics → Perturb → Reflect → Revise → Deploy
```

### Technology Stack

| System | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **PTAH** | World builder: ontology, rules, simulation |
| **SAMWISE** | Reflective AI: tracks learning, critiques assumptions |
| **AI Faculty** | In voce: competing worldviews (positioning, behavioral economics, narrative, ethics) |
| **iNQspace** | Primary teaching & lab environment: notebooks, simulations, AI-assisted builds, artifact lineage |

**How we teach AI:** Instruction, practice, and assessment run through **iNQspace** — not slide-only delivery. Students work in notebooks, run scenarios, integrate models and tools, and ship traceable artifacts. PTAH-style worlds, SAMWISE reflections, and Faculty challenges all assume work that lives in (and can be reviewed from) that environment.

### Content format: MyST

Narrative and curriculum source files are **MyST Markdown** (`.md`): CommonMark plus optional [MyST](https://mystmd.org/spec) roles and directives (admonitions, figures, cross-references, executable blocks). Jupyter notebooks remain `.ipynb` where computation is primary. This repo includes a root **`myst.yml`** so you can preview or export the book-style site with `myst start` or `myst build` ([MyST CLI](https://mystmd.org/guide/installing)).

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
myst start    # preview at http://localhost:3000 (or next free port)
# myst build  # static site under _build/
```

## AIN-M6001: Personal Attention & Influence Systems

The first course is built end-to-end — lectures, PTAH-style notebooks, and SAMWISE hooks. It serves as:

- The first course students take
- The demo of the Mag.AI-M approach
- The marketing asset for the program
- The revenue entry point

Students build an executable model of their own **attention budget, credibility, message–market fit, and content economics** — then run scenarios, reflect, and defend their model.

---

## Assessment

No exams. Students are evaluated on five dimensions (see `docs/ASSESSMENT.md`):

1. **World Construction** — clarity of ontology, correctness of rules
2. **Simulation Quality** — robustness, scenario coverage
3. **Insight** — interpretation, key variables
4. **Deployment** — real-world execution, measurable results
5. **Iteration** — refinement over time

Final credential requires a **Magisterium Thesis** (AIN-M6206): a deployed system validated by simulation with measurable outcomes.
