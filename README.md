## Source of truth: MyST

**All program narrative, curriculum, public pages, and course Markdown are authored inside the MyST project** defined by [`myst.yml`](myst.yml) and built with the [MyST CLI](https://mystmd.org/guide). That tree is **canonical**. Everything else **derives** from it:

| Derived surface | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **`myst start` / `myst build`** or **`jupyter-book build --site`** | **Jupyter Book** site (HTML in `_build/`) — same `myst.yml`; use `jupyter-book build --site` with **no trailing path** |
| **Slides** | MyST Markdown under `slides/` (`+++` frame breaks for Beamer-style export) |
| **Exercises** | MyST `{exercise}` / `{solution}` under `exercises/` ([syntax](https://mystmd.org/guide/exercises)) |
| **Exports** | PDF, Word, JATS: `jupyter-book build --pdf <file.md>` etc. ([exports](https://mystmd.org/guide/documents-exports)) |
| **iNQspace** | Teaching and execution: notebooks, simulations, lineage — **content** is ingested from these MyST-authored paths; labs run there |
| **This `README.md`** | Orientation and clone/build commands only — **not** a second curriculum. Excluded from the MyST build. |

Edit **`docs/`**, **`pages/`**, **`courses/`**, and **`index.md`**; list or pattern them in **`myst.yml`** → **`project.toc`**. Do not fork wording in the README.

**Entry page for readers:** [`index.md`](index.md) (root of the built book).

## Teach AI (iNQspace) + author content (MyST)

- **iNQspace** — where students run notebooks, simulations, and tracked artifacts.
- **MyST** — where syllabi, lectures, program docs, and public pages live as structured Markdown.
- **Jupyter Book** — **book** (site), **slides** (`slides/`), **exercises** (`exercises/`); CLI wraps the same MyST engine as `myst`.

See [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) for architecture, including **content derivation**.

## Build the book locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
myst start                    # http://localhost:3000 (or next free port)
# myst build                  # static site → _build/
jupyter-book build --site     # same site via Jupyter Book (run from repo root; no `.` at end)
# jupyter-book build --pdf slides/ain-m6001_lecture01_intro.md   # example PDF export
```

## Repository layout (canonical files)

```

```

**Curriculum tables and course detail:** open the built site or the Markdown under `docs/` and `pages/` — do not duplicate here.
